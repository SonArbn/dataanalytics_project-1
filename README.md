# Data analytics: Dating apps

Project Data Analytics for Psychology and Business
   

## Research question:

What are the reasons for good and bad ratings in dating apps? 
j
    - How are the different apps rated over the years?
    - Which app has more favorable responses?
    - Have those favorable responses stayed consistent through the years or have they increased/decreased?
    - How the app-ratings/comments distinguish from each other?
    - What are the common issues for those who rate the app below 3/5?

## Relevance

Dating apps have come to stay and constitute an unstoppable social phenomenon, as evidenced by the usage and published literature on the subject over the past five years. These apps have become a new way to meet and interact with potential partners, changing the rules of the game and romantic and sexual relationships for millions of people all over the world. By 2021 dating app revenues have increased every year since 2015, reaching $5.61 billion with over 323 million people worldwide using dating apps. 

And even a pandemic can't stop the search for love. In March 2020, Tinder recorded its highest number of swipes on a single day: 3 billion. From March to May 2020, OkCupid saw a 700% increase in dates. And on Bumble, video calls increased by 70%.

App-developper had to respond to the pandemic through changes to socio-technical arrangements, new user prescriptions, and the curation of corporate data and success stories. 

This project picked four different dating apps to analyze in the span from 2020-2022 which are somehow different in style and usage.


### Tinder
Tinder fundamentally changed online dating by removing the seriousness and giving users more control.


### Bumble
Bumble is designed to give women control of the experience. Bumble was started by Tinder co-founder Whitney Wolfe Herd, who left after tensions at the company. Bumble is consideret the main rival in North Armerica.


### OkCupid
OkCupid features multiple-choice questions to match members. It is one of the older dating apps and is a U.S.-based, internationally operating online dating, friendship, and formerly also a social networking website and application.


### Hinge
Hinge may have been destined to be one of the many dating app failures, but the team reformed the app for long-term relationships and has hit the ground running in North America.


**The goal** of this project is to analyze how the user view has developed over the last two years.Therefore an analysis of the rating, the user comments and the Number of Thumbs up received by a person will be made. Furthermore wordclowds will show what polarized the reviews given by the user. We hope that this project will help app developers or investors who want to improve their dating app or pick out the next big dating app.
